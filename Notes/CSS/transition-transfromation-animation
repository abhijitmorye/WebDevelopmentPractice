Transisition property:


1)  smoothens the animations that we apppy to the elements in html



eg :  button {
				background-color: red;
				transistion: background-color 0.5s ease-in-out 1s
			 }
			 
		
	  button:hover {
					background-color: yellow}
					
					
	in above example, whenever you hove on the button, its background color changes from red to yellow. Here transition property define how we can transition background color from red to yellow.
	
	Syntax--> transition: property duration style delay
	
						property: property(property1,property2,all) to which animation or effect is applied ( in example its is background-color)
						
						duration : duration bwtween transition from one effect to another given effect ( in example we have given duration as 0.5s so color from red to yellow will be changes after 0.5s from the moment you hover over button)
						
						style: different style that are applied (ease,ease-in-out,linear,speedy)
						
						delay: delay before effect actually takes place ( in example. we have given delay of one sec, so after 1 second our effect will actually take place)
						
						
2) every browser has different support for transition, to specify the browser specific transition property, we have to add prefix for each browser;

		-webkit-<css property> : for chrome and safari
		-moz-<css property>
		
		

Transform property: 

		specifies the transformation of elements
		
		
		1) translate(x-shift,y-shift) : translate or move the elements aling x and y axis
		
		   syntax--> transform: translate(x-axis-shift,y-axix-shift) i.e (horizontal shift, vertical shift) i.e (positive means right horizontal-negative means left horizontal && positive means in top direction and negative menas downward direction)
		   
		   
		2) scale(decimal value) : scales the elements by specified value.
		
			syntax--> scales the item to which this property is applied.
			
		3) rotate(angle) : rotate the element by specifies angle.
		
		4) skew(angle) : skews or rotate the elements by specified angle.
		
		
		
		
Animation property:

1) can write animation by specifying "@keyframes" keyword

syntax--> @keyframes name-of-animation(usercoicename) {
			
			from(or 0%) {property/style: value1;} --// here start property with specified value i.e. value1
			
			to (or 100%) {property/tyle: value2} --// ehere end property with specified value i.e. value2
			
			}
			
			
	0% or 100% means instead of mentioning from or to starting point, we can give percentage or steps like at 20%,at 40% and then specify value at that point
	
	
e.g. --> @keyframes black-to-red {

			0% {
			background-color: red;
			}
			
			50% {
			background-color: orange;
			}
			
			100% {
			background-color: yellow;
			}
			
			}
			

2) how to apply animation that we have created to an element: 

		use syntax--> animation-name: name_of_animation_we_have_given
		
		
3) how to start an animation:
	
		even though we assign animation-name to  element, we cant see animation running why? bcuz we need to specify the duration for which animation will run.
		
		use syntax--> animation-duration: 50s --// this will start animation once you load the site and run it for the 50s
		

4) how to specify the speed of animation?

		use syntax--> animation-timing-function: (ease,ease-in,ease-out,ease-in-out,linear)
		
5) how to give delay before starting an animation?

		use syntax--> animation-delay: 2s
		
6) how to specify iteration count for animation?

		use-syntax--> animation-iteration-count: 2
		
		we can specify the animation to be run infinitely till user leave the site by using infinite keyword.
		
7) how to reverse the animation?

		use synatx--> animation-direction: noraml
										 : reverse-- will reverse the animation i.e will start animation from 100% to 0%
										 : alternate-- will alternate between two normal and reverse.
