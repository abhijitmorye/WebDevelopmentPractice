How to add background image to text or heading:

Ans:

1. create h2 content

2. add "backround-image"

3. For background-color use, "liner-gradient" property for background image

4. since headings or paragraphs are block level element, background image will be applied for full width of parent. so set "display: property to "inline-block"

5. set "-webkit-background-clip" property to set "text"

6. Above property will clip the background-color or image behind the text but it wont will be visible since text is sittin on top of background-color or image.

7. to make it visible, use "color: transparent" property so thet background will be visible.

Syntax:

		h2 {
		
		background-image: linear-gradient(to right, lihtgreen,dark green);
		-webkit-background-clip: text;
		color: transparent;
		display: inline-block;
		
		}

how to make div or box bend but inner contents should be at same position as before.

Ans:

here idea is to skew or rotate outer div vertically by small angle but its inside content should be at same position as before.

1. We add transform: skew(some degreee) to parent div

2. This will roatet div as well as its content by some angle.

3. To restore content's position we have to skew it in opposite direction of parent's skew.


Syntax:		div {
					transform: skew(5deg);
				}
				
			div > * {
						transform: skew(-5deg);
					}

How to rotate card or div on HTMl :


suppose we have html : part1

				<div class="card">
					<div class="card__side">
						
					</div>
				</div>
				
				
Ans: we have to rotate the card by 180 deg.


Syntax :

		.card {
		
			percpective: 150rem // The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.
			
			
		}
		
		.card_side {
		
			background-color:red;
			transition: all 0.8s;
			
		}

		
		.cards:hover .cards_side { // this means that whenever outer card or div is hovered, rotate the inner card or div by 180 deg.
		
			transform: rotateY(180deg)l
		
		}
		

now we have added percepctive to out card but till this point we cant see two different color of card if they rotate

html part2 :


			<div class="card">
					<div class="card__side card__side--front">
						front
					</div>
					<div class="card__side card__side--back">
						Back
					</div>
			</div>
			
At this point, now we have 2 card/div on top of each other. here idea is when front card/div is visible, back card/div is rotated 180 deg back i.e. not visible.


	Syntax :	
	
		
		.card {
		
			percpective: 150rem // The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.
			
			
		}
		
		.card_side {
		
			background-color:red;
			transition: all 0.8s;
			
		}
		
		.card_side--front { // this one is on front so no transform is applied
		
			background-color:red;
			
		}
		
		.card_side--back { // this one is on back so  transform is applied
		
			background-color:red;
			transform: rotate(180deg); // already 180 deg rotated
			
		}

		
		.cards:hover .cards_side { // this means that whenever outer card or div is hovered, rotate the inner cards i.e (front and back) or div by 180 deg.
		
			transform: rotateY(180deg)l
		
		}
		

At this point, we have two cards ready that will be moved forth and back according when we hover over the card(main-div). But they will be positioned one down another not will be stacked.
To give the stack effect, we need to apply "position:absolute" to front and back card and  "position:relative" to the main card or parent card.

	
	Syntax:
	
	
		.card {
		
			percpective: 150rem // The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.
			position: relative;
			height: 50rem; // since due to relative positioning, this parent will loose its height, we have to give same height as child to this div so that it will gain its original position.
			
		}
		
		.card_side {
		
			background-color:red;
			height: 50rem
			transition: all 0.8s;
			position: absolute;
			width: 100%; //will aquire total postion of parent card.
			backface-visibility: hidden; // this property will hide the back card.
			
		}
		
		.card_side--front { // this one is on front so no transform is applied
		
			background-color:red;
			
		}
		
		.card_side--back { // this one is on back so  transform is applied
		
			background-color:red;
			transform: rotate(180deg); // already 180 deg rotated
			
		}

		
		.cards:hover .cards_side { // this means that whenever outer card or div is hovered, rotate the inner cards i.e (front and back) or div by 180 deg.
		
			transform: rotateY(180deg)l
		
		}

Q: whenever we apply width to break long heading in 2 part and then add padding to it, the right space in first break and left space in 2nd break are not equal when we break heading? 
how to fix that?


Ans:

	syntax:
	
	<h2> The Amazing Spiderman </h2>
	
	
	h2 {
	
		width: 50%; // this will break heading in two boxes.
		padding: 1rem 2rem ; // this padding wont be consistent in both break box as it will consider the both boxes as single heading or line
		box-decoration-break: clone; // this will give you same padding to both boxes.
	
	}
