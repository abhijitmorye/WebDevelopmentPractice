Gradient : transition between two colors --> 

two types of gradient :

1) radial-gradient : gradient or transition of color starts from the center and moves around the center 

		stntax: 
					background: radial-gradient(red 10% , orange 20%, yellow 40%)


2) linear-gradient : gradient starts linearly from one particular direction i.e to right, to left, to bottom, to top, to top-right etc.

		Syntax : 
					background: linear-gradient(to right,red,blue,green,yellow)
					
					

3) Viewheight(vh) OR viewwidth(vw) : 1 vh or 1 vw is eaqual to the 1% of your media width i.e mobile,laptop etc.
